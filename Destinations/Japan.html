    <p>The First Place that would be a good get away vaction is hawaii. Out of seeing ancient temples to experiencing magical landscape theres more things to do there then you  think.</p>
    <P>Hawaii is a very special place that holds some of the most beautiful landscapes known to man, between the tropical beaches, smells,taste etc.</P>
    <p>One thing that your family might be able to do once you get in a hawaiin location might be scuba diving</p>
